# IIOS Project State Index

State classification: **CANONICAL**
Snapshot: 2026-10-06
Authority: this file is the **only canonical Current State Index**.

## 1. Canonical state

```

Current canonical main is the sole source of current implementation truth. The Git ref, not a duplicated document hash, defines the current main SHA.
A0 acceptance: `docs/iios/A0_ACCEPTANCE_2026-10-05.md`.

## 2. Investment Core capability boundary

```
user-selected company + cutoff
→ admitted PIT evidence
→ Reality / Trust / Quality / Value Drivers / Thesis
→ Primary Valuation
→ Independent Forecast
→ Return / Required Return
→ Risk / Portfolio
→ Optional MIE
→ Decision
```

The core decision boundary is implemented and has a real CATL/300750 E2E.

Not an Investment Core entry/completion gate:

- CSI800 historical membership;
- CSI Industry historical classification;
- full-market historical universe;
- PIT Security Master for universe construction;
- FM forecast research capability.

Those remain separate Research Track capabilities.

## 3. CORE-04 / 300750 canonical result

Case: `RC-CN-A-300750-20261004`

- current PIT price: 291.11 CNY/share;
- Reality: PASS;
- Quality Gate: CONDITIONAL;
- Value Driver: PASS;
- Primary Valuation: PASS;
- Independent Forecast: PASS;
- Thesis Admission: ADMITTED;
- Thesis: INTACT;
- Trust: REVALIDATION;
- H: 3Y with explicit Horizon Override;
- MIE: OPTIONAL_EXPLANATORY and absent;
- Expected Annualized Return: about 14.20%;
- Required Return: 10%;
- Risk: PASS;
- final action: REVIEW_REQUIRED;
- new capital: FALSE.

This is an accepted system result, not a claim that the security should be bought.

## 4. Current blockers

### A1 — Company-side Evidence Closure

A1 is PASS / MERGED as an engineering and evidence-closure milestone.

Completed sub-batches:
- A1-01 Economic Evidence Bridge = PASS / MERGED;
- A1-02 Capital Allocation + Trust/Governance Evidence Closure = PASS / MERGED;
- A1-03 Quality Gate Integration = PASS / MERGED.

The company-side evidence chain is integrated into the existing Quality Gate semantics. For 300750, Quality Gate remains CONDITIONAL and new capital remains FALSE. A1 completion does not imply BUY/ADD.

### Productization

RP-01 Risk / Portfolio Production Contract is merged in canonical main:
- PR #84;
- merge commit d2180754ef6b3e71ecf5eaad9ad7d6224d46af00;
- explicit risk budget and portfolio capacity inputs;
- fail-closed package validation;
- deterministic audit hash;
- no Decision Precedence change.

C1 Machine Publication is PASS / MERGED / CANONICAL:
- PR #97;
- merge commit b9a8ff0fe1341a56f363fb058677dbd50a4f87b8;
- dedicated C1 CI #7 = SUCCESS;
- 5 C1 tests passed;
- JSON Schema validation and diff check passed.

C2 Human Report / Report Quality Gate is PASS / MERGED / CANONICAL:
- PR #101;
- merge commit 75bb360436286ae950a05028769701380120e561;
- dedicated C2 CI #2 = SUCCESS;
- 7 C2 tests passed;
- report and QA JSON Schema validation plus diff check passed.

C4 Expectation Gap Production Integration is PASS / MERGED / CANONICAL:
- PR #105;
- merge commit 07d45c18df8df9100d4866dd5f92fa95ccdb7186;
- dedicated C4 CI #7 = SUCCESS on exact head aacf1c0cc715697bfac2aa0bae5e2f0a4c899ad2;
- 75 tests passed;
- executable acceptance harness 7 / 7 PASS;
- compileall and git diff --check passed;
- acceptance: docs/iios/C4_ACCEPTANCE_2026-10-06.md.

C5 Positioning / Sizing is PASS / MERGED / CANONICAL:
- PR #108;
- merge commit cdf998cd21776363914f178e648f03ec0c1539f8;
- dedicated C5 CI #7 = SUCCESS on exact head f9758beb683b3ba044fc9a153018050fa4ff09d9;
- 86 tests passed;
- executable acceptance harness 9 / 9 PASS;
- compileall and git diff --check passed;
- acceptance: docs/iios/C5_ACCEPTANCE_2026-10-06.md.

Canonical Stage C milestone state:
- C6 Human Execution Receipt = PASS / MERGED / CANONICAL;
- C7 Full Lifecycle E2E = PASS / MERGED / CANONICAL.
- Current next Stage C boundary = C8 Final Independent Red-team / MVP Acceptance.

The separately tracked full Investment Core / Risk Portfolio CI regressions remain non-blocking for C4/C5/C6/C7 acceptance and are not current Stage C capability gaps.

The full Investment Core / Risk Portfolio CI still carries separately tracked pre-existing regressions; C4/C5 acceptance is independently bounded and these failures are not treated as C4/C5 capability evidence.

## 5. State classification

### CANONICAL

Only current accepted state on `main` is authoritative.

Examples:
- this file;
- current `STATUS.md`;
- production code / schemas / tests on `main`;
- accepted milestone records explicitly referenced from this index.

### HISTORICAL

Immutable past-state material. It explains history but cannot define current capability.

Known historical/superseded state records include:

- `docs/iios/STATE_RECONCILIATION_2026-10-04.md`;
- `docs/iios/IIOS_CURRENT_STATE_INDEX.md`;
- `docs/iios/IIOS_CONSOLIDATED_POST_REDTEAM_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN_2026-10-04.md`;
- pre-adjudication B1 proposal documents.

### DIAGNOSTIC

Non-authoritative experiments, probes, unmerged work and temporary validation artifacts.

No diagnostic branch or PR is a current capability until merged to `main`.

## 6. New-development gate

Every new batch MUST begin from:

```
canonical main
    +
docs/PROJECT_STATE_INDEX.md
```

Then:

1. verify current main SHA;
2. verify the target batch is not already merged;
3. read the relevant normative contract;
4. create a fresh branch from current main;
5. keep the PR scope inside the declared batch;
6. merge only after CI evidence passes.

Never continue from a stale branch merely because it contains previous work.

## 7. Authority precedence

```
canonical main
    >
Current State Index
    >
normative contracts / schemas / production tests
    >
independent CI evidence
    >
historical records
    >
chat context
```

A diagnostic or historical record can identify a problem, but cannot promote itself into capability.

## 8. Current next batch

**C7 Full Lifecycle E2E = PASS / MERGED / CANONICAL**

C7 is the latest completed Stage C capability and is already synchronized into canonical `main`.

Implementation:
- PR #112;
- merge commit: `82d1911c985791e4b76f63d792588d175ee505f8`.

Acceptance:
- `docs/iios/C7_ACCEPTANCE_2026-10-06.md`;
- dedicated C7 Actions run #6 = SUCCESS on exact head `43664c9bee33b3d53f212428da019e197a9fcaf2`;
- 74 related tests passed;
- acceptance harness 4 / 4 PASS;
- compileall and git diff-check PASS.

Canonical state synchronization:
- PR #113;
- merge commit: `a5ac4b8451041bbd38bcaa73fa39954ec6533f02`.

**Immediate next development boundary: C8 Final Independent Red-team / MVP Acceptance.**

C8 is an acceptance-only boundary. It must not be interpreted as permission to add new investment capability, scheduler/alerts, automatic execution, broader market screening, or new P3/P4/MIE model families.

Historical milestone sections remain evidence of past checkpoints and do not override the current C7 → C8 boundary.

## 9. Stage C current development boundary

**C7 — Full Lifecycle E2E = PASS / MERGED / CANONICAL**

C7 proves the complete operating loop from Decision Revision through Human Approval, Execution Receipt, Trigger/Monitoring/Validation, deterministic replay, new Revision, Machine Publication and Human Report. Historical state remains append-only and projections remain non-authoritative.

Detailed roadmap: `docs/iios/IIOS_STAGE_C_PRODUCTIZATION_PLAN_v0.1.md`.

Immediate next batch: **C8 — Final Independent Red-team / MVP Acceptance**.

Parallel FM Research remains separate.
