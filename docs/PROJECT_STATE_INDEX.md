# IIOS Project State Index

State classification: **CANONICAL**
Snapshot: 2026-10-05
Authority: this file is the **only canonical Current State Index**.

## 1. Canonical state

```
G2 R10 Reference Governance Runtime = FROZEN
        ↓
B0 Repair = PASS
        ↓
B1 Investment Semantics v0.3 = PASS / FROZEN
        ↓
CORE-00 = PASS / MERGED
        ↓
CORE-01 = PASS / MERGED
        ↓
CORE-02 Company Economic Core = PASS / MERGED
        ↓
CORE-03 Real 300750 = PASS / MERGED
        ↓
CORE-04 Production Decision Kernel = PASS / MERGED
        ↓
CORE-04 × 300750 Final Decision Chain = PASS / REVIEW_REQUIRED / NO NEW CAPITAL
        ↓
A0 Governance / State Cleanup = PASS / MERGED
        ↓
A1-01 Economic Evidence Bridge = PASS / MERGED
        ↓
A1 Company-side Evidence Closure = IN PROGRESS
        ↓
A1-02 Capital Allocation + Trust/Governance Evidence Closure = NEXT
```

Current canonical main is the sole source of current implementation truth. The Git ref, not a duplicated document hash, defines the current main SHA.
A0 acceptance: `docs/iios/A0_ACCEPTANCE_2026-10-05.md`.

## 2. Investment Core capability boundary

```
user-selected company + cutoff
→ admitted PIT evidence
→ Reality / Trust / Quality / Value Drivers / Thesis
→ Primary Valuation
→ Independent Forecast
→ Return / Required Return
→ Risk / Portfolio
→ Optional MIE
→ Decision
```

The core decision boundary is implemented and has a real CATL/300750 E2E.

Not an Investment Core entry/completion gate:

- CSI800 historical membership;
- CSI Industry historical classification;
- full-market historical universe;
- PIT Security Master for universe construction;
- FM forecast research capability.

Those remain separate Research Track capabilities.

## 3. CORE-04 / 300750 canonical result

Case: `RC-CN-A-300750-20261004`

- current PIT price: 291.11 CNY/share;
- Reality: PASS;
- Quality Gate: CONDITIONAL;
- Value Driver: PASS;
- Primary Valuation: PASS;
- Independent Forecast: PASS;
- Thesis Admission: ADMITTED;
- Thesis: INTACT;
- Trust: REVALIDATION;
- H: 3Y with explicit Horizon Override;
- MIE: OPTIONAL_EXPLANATORY and absent;
- Expected Annualized Return: about 14.20%;
- Required Return: 10%;
- Risk: PASS;
- final action: REVIEW_REQUIRED;
- new capital: FALSE.

This is an accepted system result, not a claim that the security should be bought.

## 4. Current blockers

### A1 — Company-side Evidence Closure

Primary unresolved company-side gate:

- incremental ROIC evidence;
- earnings → OCF → FCF conversion;
- CAPEX → D&A → FCF bridge;
- working-capital normalization;
- fuller Trust / governance revalidation.

Quality remains CONDITIONAL until evidence supports a stronger state.

### Productization

The current Investment Core still needs production lifecycle work:

- Decision Revision state transitions;
- Human Approval / Current Projection;
- Trigger lifecycle;
- Monitoring / Validation;
- Machine Publication;
- Human Report / Report Quality Gate;
- second-company acceptance;
- final independent red-team.

## 5. State classification

### CANONICAL

Only current accepted state on `main` is authoritative.

Examples:
- this file;
- current `STATUS.md`;
- production code / schemas / tests on `main`;
- accepted milestone records explicitly referenced from this index.

### HISTORICAL

Immutable past-state material. It explains history but cannot define current capability.

Known historical/superseded state records include:

- `docs/iios/STATE_RECONCILIATION_2026-10-04.md`;
- `docs/iios/IIOS_CURRENT_STATE_INDEX.md`;
- `docs/iios/IIOS_CONSOLIDATED_POST_REDTEAM_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN_2026-10-04.md`;
- pre-adjudication B1 proposal documents.

### DIAGNOSTIC

Non-authoritative experiments, probes, unmerged work and temporary validation artifacts.

No diagnostic branch or PR is a current capability until merged to `main`.

## 6. New-development gate

Every new batch MUST begin from:

```
canonical main
    +
docs/PROJECT_STATE_INDEX.md
```

Then:

1. verify current main SHA;
2. verify the target batch is not already merged;
3. read the relevant normative contract;
4. create a fresh branch from current main;
5. keep the PR scope inside the declared batch;
6. merge only after CI evidence passes.

Never continue from a stale branch merely because it contains previous work.

## 7. Authority precedence

```
canonical main
    >
Current State Index
    >
normative contracts / schemas / production tests
    >
independent CI evidence
    >
historical records
    >
chat context
```

A diagnostic or historical record can identify a problem, but cannot promote itself into capability.

## 8. Current next batch

**A1 Company-side Evidence Closure — IN PROGRESS**

Completed sub-batch:
- **A1-01 Economic Evidence Bridge = PASS / MERGED**
- Acceptance: `docs/iios/A1_01_ACCEPTANCE_2026-10-05.md`

A1-01 established the deterministic CAPEX → D&A → FCF, Earnings → OCF → FCF, Working Capital and Incremental ROIC proxy layer without changing Decision Kernel semantics.

Next sub-batch:
- **A1-02 Capital Allocation + Trust/Governance Evidence Closure**

A1 is not complete until the remaining company-side evidence is closed and the resulting Quality state is explicitly integrated and tested.
